# Hello, world!

The first program most people ever write is a simple "Hello, world!" program, and here is how you would do it in Wally:

> This program prints "Hello, world!" to the console, and then exits with a return code of 0.

```cpp
fn main(args: array<string>): int {
    println("Hello, world!");
    return 0;
}
```
